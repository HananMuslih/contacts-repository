# Contacts repository

For this project, you should put your address book under version control. In particular, use records in the vCard format, which nearly every address manager uses either natively or as an import/export option.

Ideally, you should use your own data, but I have provided a few samples from my personal address book; I have only included some businesses with public contact information (that may or may not be in business currently, some are years old).

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
